    "1. `bytes_to_state(bytes)`: This function converts a byte array into a state array. It first converts the byte array into a hexadecimal string using the `hex()` method. Then, it divides this string into 16-character chunks and converts each chunk into an integer using base 16 (hexadecimal). Finally, it returns a list containing these integers, forming the state array.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `rotr(val, r)`: This function performs a right rotation (circular shift) of the value `val` by `r` bits. It achieves this by first shifting `val` to the right by `r` bits using the right shift operator `>>`. Then, it extracts the bits that were shifted out (which are `r` rightmost bits of `val`) using bitwise AND with `(1<<r)-1`. After that, it shifts these extracted bits to the left by `(64-r)` bits and combines them with the shifted `val` using bitwise OR `|`. This effectively rotates the bits of `val` to the right by `r` positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `get_random_bytes(num)`: This function generates a byte array containing `num` random bytes using the `urandom()` function from the `os` module. It imports the `urandom()` function and calls it with the `num` parameter to obtain a byte array of random bytes, which it then returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `hex_print(data)`: This function prints data in a formatted way, where each element of `data` is a tuple containing a text label and a corresponding byte array value. It iterates over each tuple in `data`, formatting and printing the label along with the hexadecimal representation of the byte array value. It ensures that the hexadecimal representation is prefixed with `0x` and aligns the output for better readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "These helper functions are useful for various tasks such as converting between different data representations, performing bitwise operations, generating random bytes, and printing data in a formatted manner. They provide essential functionalities that are commonly used in cryptography and other programming tasks."

After that, it attempts to decrypt the ciphertext using the `ascon_decrypt()` function and verifies the authenticity of the received plaintext.\n",
